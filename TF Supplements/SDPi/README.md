# DEV / TF Supplements / Service-oriented Device Point-of-care Interoperability (SDPi)
IHE Devices Domain (DEV) technical framework (TF) supplement work products that are either in development, in Public Comment or Trial Implementation and may be published on the [IHE Technical Frameworks web page](https://www.ihe.net/resources/technical_frameworks/#dev).  This includes both the Word .docx files, any related files (e.g., separate graphics that are included, or PlantUML source files) and their PDF rendering.

This folder contains all the work products related to the Service-oriented Device Point-of-care Interoperability (SDPi) supplement.

NOTE:  Supplement revisions should also be supported until the trial implementation (TI) versions have been converted to final text (FT) and integrated into the IHE DEV TF.

Note:  Though this was originally modeled after the IHE FTP site, the folder structure for each supplement may evolve as the development processes evolve.
