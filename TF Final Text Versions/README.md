# DEV / TF Final Text Versions
IHE Devices Domain (DEV) technical framework (TF) document volumes that have been published to date on the [IHE Technical Frameworks web page](https://www.ihe.net/resources/technical_frameworks/#dev).  This includes both the Word .docx files, any related files (e.g., separate graphics that are included, or PlantUML source files) and their PDF rendering.

Note:  This is modeled on the original IHE FTP site; it may be modified in the future as the TF development / maintenance process evolves.
